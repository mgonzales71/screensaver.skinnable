Skinnable Screensaver
=====================

With this addon skin developers have the ability to create a skin customized screensaver for their skin by creating the file script-screensaver-skinnable-custom.xml in their skin's XML folder.

The screensaver will check for this file in the skin's XML folder.

Skin resolutions currently supported: 1080i, 720p, 21x9, 16x9 & 4x3Hirez.

If no script-screensaver-skinnable-custom.xml is found it will use the file skin.default.xml that is included with the screensaver itself.

The included skin.default.xml fallback XML file is very basic and will display a black background and if available the skin's logo/icon that will fade in and out.

Let me know if you encounter any bugs or issues.
